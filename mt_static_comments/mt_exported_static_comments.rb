# Following code is a quick hack, consists of Matt Palmer's code and
# some codes combined with Post/Site. this code should be refactored later
# to make consistent with other latest Jekyll modules.
# 
# expected output for _comments directory is by the hack added
# as https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-import/tree/mt_comment_hack
#
# Note:
# 1) post output has a unique post_id (copy of entry_id of mt_entry table)
# 2) comment output has post_id, too
# 3) Comments are sorted by comment_id, which is copy of comment_id of
#    mt_comment table
